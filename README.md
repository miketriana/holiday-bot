# Celebrate!
HolidayBot is a Discord chat bot that wishes people happy holidays! Invite HolidayBot to your server, tell it which countries' holidays your server celebrates, and give it a channel to announce in. The bot will post automatic announcements each morning in the respective time zone to alert the server of any holidays being celebrated.

The bot currently supports only six countries, but more worldwide support is planned in the future.
